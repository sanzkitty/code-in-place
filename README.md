# COVID-19 Data Visualization

In times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to rely on data to understand the patterns of the pandemic. As COVID-19 is something really new to us, we can be prepared by predicting where the data is headed via the underlying patterns. Simply collecting data is not going to help the mass comprehend the situation. By visualizing this data, we can communicate it effectively and efficiently to a broad audience. Data visualization allows everyone to grasp complex information. In my country Nepal, we are still in the early stages of the pandemic but it's increasing exponentially. Fortunately, while the numbers are in 100s right now, through this data we can see how fast the situation can get worst if we aren't careful enough. Here, we can initially see other countries start around the same number and then exponentially increase in the number of positive cases and deaths. This helps us predict where the data and the pandemic is headed and allows us to understand the severity of the situation so we can take the necessary measures early on.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Install Python
* Install Matplotlib
* Install Pandas

### Installing

This is a very basic Data Visualization Project that can be run easily on any  integrated development environment (IDE). 
I highly recommend installing Anaconda Navigator and running Data Visualization projects on Jupyter Notebook.
